# Heart-Attack-Risk-prediction

Heart attacks have become an alarmingly common occurrence, afflicting even young people when least expected. This project aims to reveal insights into the prevention of heart attacks through predictive data analysis. Using a dataset of numerous patient health factors like blood pressure, heart rate, lifestyle behaviours, and medical history, we will develop a multivariate risk model to estimate an individual's likelihood of experiencing a heart attack. By uncovering the complex interplay between the many demographic, genetic, and behavioural variables that influence cardiovascular outcomes, our goal is an actionable risk calculator to empower at-risk individuals to lead proactive, healthy lives. This undertaking promises life-saving impact - identifying those in danger early enough to make pivotal lifestyle changes, seek medical care, and avoid becoming another tragic statistic. Through compassionate data science, we endeavour to illuminate the path towards a future of vibrant, thriving heart.
